This project explores foundational and advanced techniques in machine learning and deep learning, including neural networks, convolutional models (CNNs), clustering algorithms, and generative adversarial networks (GANs). The repository also contains datasets, Jupyter notebooks implementing experiments (e.g., for CIFAR-10 classification), and examples of unsupervised and supervised methods. The goal is to provide a hands-on, educational compendium of modern AI techniques and architectures.
